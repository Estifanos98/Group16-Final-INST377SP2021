    <h1>About Page</h1>
    <p>
      We strive to help people both young and old who may not know what movie or
      tv show to watch. <br />
      Our application easily searches and find what tv shows or movies they
      could possibly watch based on the filters they select.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our main goal is to help our clients save time by avoiding time wasted on
      browsing for movies or tv shows <br />
      just because they do not know what movie or tv show to watch.
