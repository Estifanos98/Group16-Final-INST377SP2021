      We strive to help people both young and old who may not know what movies or
      tv shows to watch. 
      <br />
      <br/>
      Our application easily searches and finds what tv shows or movies they
      could possibly watch based on the filters they select.
    <br/>
    <br/>
      Our main goal is to help our clients save time by avoiding time wasted on
      browsing for movies or tv shows <br />
      just because they do not know what movie or tv show to watch.
